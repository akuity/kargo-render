# Configuring Kargo Render

Kargo Render is configured using a file named `kargo-render.yaml`, which should
be stored at the root of the default branch of your GitOps repository.

The role of `kargo-render.yaml` is simply to enumerate your environment
branches, and for each, specify:

* Which configuration management tools to use in rendering that environment
  branch -- and what the inputs to those tools are.

* Where to place the rendered manifests within the environment branch.

* Other policies, such as:

    * Whether to commit directly to the environment branch or open a PR instead.

    * Whether to produce a manifest per Kubernetes resource or combine all
      resources into a single manifest.

## Basic configuration

Before introducing example configurations, it's worth a brief digression to
discuss the different perspectives teams may adopt with respect to their
environments and applications.

With an _application-centric_ perspective, a team treats their applications
as "first class." _Environments_ are simply different instances of an
application. This perspective might be adopted by a team that is developing and
deploying multiple, distinct, monolithic applications that can be deployed
independently of one another.

With an _environment-centric_ perspective, a team treats their environments as
"first class." _Applications_ are simply different pieces of an environment.
This perspective might be adopted by a team that is employing a microsevice
architecture wherein each "application" is a single component of a larger whole
that should be deployed as an atomic unit.

Understanding these two perspectives is important insofar as it impacts how a
team is likely to organize their GitOps repositories.

A team with an application-centric approach is likely to use a GitOps repository
_per application_. Each Kargo Render-managed environment branch within that
repository will contain environment-specific manifests for the one application.
In contrast, a team with an environment-centric approach is likely to include
configuration for multiple applications in a single GitOps repository. Each
Kargo Render-managed environment branch within that repository will contain
environment-specific manifests for multiple applications.

Ultimately, the fundamental difference between the two approaches is whether a
single GitOps repository houses manifests for one application or for multiple.
With the latter scenario being the (very slightly) more complex of the two, all
examples that follow will involve _two_ applications -- `foo` and `bar`. When we
render manifests for an environment branch, we wish to render manifests for
_both_ apps.

## Config management tool configuration

Behind the scene Kargo Render uses Argo CD Repo Server to render manifests. More
information about supported settings is available in Argo CD
[documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/application_sources/).

<TabItem value="kustomize" label="Kustomize">

For each environment branch, the configuration below specifies the location of
environment-specific Kustomize overlays for each application. It also specifies
where within each environment branch to store the rendered manifests for each
application.

```yaml
configVersion: v1alpha1
branchConfigs:
- name: env/test
  appConfigs:
    foo:
      configManagement:
        path: env/test/foo # test overlay for app "foo"
      outputPath: foo
    bar:
      configManagement:
        path: env/test/bar # test overlay for app "bar"
      outputPath: bar
- name: env/stage
  appConfigs:
    foo:
      configManagement:

For each environment branch, the configuration below specifies a release name,
chart, and values file to use as arguments to the `helm template` command for
each application. It also specifies where within each environment branch to
store the rendered manifests for each application.

```yaml
configVersion: v1alpha1
branchConfigs:
- name: env/test
  appConfigs:
    foo:
      configManagement:

## Keeping things DRY

In our introductory examples, you may notice that the configuration for each
environment branch looks remarkably similar to the configuration for every other
environment branch. Paths and other values for each environment were
consistently a function of the environment's name. This is an obvious
[DRY violation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).

To keep configuration more succinct, Kargo Render supports matching environment
branches with applicable configuration using patterns (i.e. regular
expressions). Capture groups can be used in those patterns to extract meaningful
information, such as environment name, and paths that reference those capture
groups will be expanded accordingly.

The following examples are equivalent to our initial examples, but are
considerably more succinct:

<Tabs groupId="dry-kargo-render">

<TabItem value="kustomize" label="Kustomize">

```yaml
configVersion: v1alpha1
branchConfigs:
- pattern: env/(\w+)
  appConfigs:
    foo:
      configManagement:
        path: env/${1}/foo
      outputPath: foo
    bar:
      configManagement:
        path: env/${1}/bar
      outputPath: bar
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="helm" label="Helm">

```yaml
configVersion: v1alpha1
branchConfigs:
- pattern: env/(\w+)
  appConfigs:
    foo:
      configManagement:
        path: charts/foo
        helm:
          releaseName: foo
          namespace: foo #optional
          valueFiles:
          - env/${1}/foo/values.yaml
      outputPath: foo
    bar:
      configManagement:
        path: charts/bar
        helm:
          releaseName: bar
          namespace: bar #optional
          valueFiles:
          - env/${1}/bar/values.yaml
      outputPath: bar
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Other options

This section covers environment branch configuration options that are not
specific to any configuration management tool.

### Pull requests

For any environment branch, you can specify that Kargo Render should open pull
requests for changes to that branch instead of committing those changes
directly. (Committing changes directly is the default behavior.) This is an
effective method of creating opportunities for manifest changes to be reviewed
and before they are applied by a CD platform that is tracking the head of that
environment branch.

This option can be applied as follows:

```yaml
configVersion: v1alpha1
branchConfigs:
# ...
- name: env/prod
  appConfigs:
    my-app:
      configManagement:
        # omitted for brevity
  prs:
    enabled: true
```

:::info
At this time, pull requests are only supported for remote GitOps repositories
hosted on GitHub, but support for most major Git hosting providers is planned.
:::

When PRs are enabled, changes are, by default, committed to a predictably named
intermediate branch. PRs are opened _from_ that intermediate branch _to_ the
environment branch. If _new_ changes are queued up for the environment branch
and such a PR is already open, the new commits are applied to the intermediate
branch, which implicitly amends the open PR. This makes a single PR a record of
all pending changes to a given environment branch.

Some teams may prefer a different approach wherein every change headed for an
environment branch results in a new PR. In this case, if change `a` results in a
new PR `A` and that PR has not yet been merged, a subsequent change `b` results
in a new PR `B` that contains the commits for _both_ changes `a` and `b`. To
catch the environment branch all the way up with both changes, `B` can be merged
and `A` can be closed, unmerged. Alternatively, in this scenario, `A` could be
merged to catch the environment branch up to change `a` and `B` can remain open
for further consideration.

:::caution
The downside to this option is that for teams making frequent commits to the
default branch of the GitOps repository, there may be _many_ open PRs at any
given moment and _many_ of them may end up closed, unmerged. This can get rather
noisy, so it's worth carefully considering whether you need this behavior.
:::

To enable this:

```yaml
configVersion: v1alpha1
branchConfigs:
# ...
- name: env/prod
  # ...
  prs:
    enabled: true
    useUniqueBranchNames: true
```

### Combining manifests

For any app configuration within an environment branch, you can specify that
Kargo Render should combine all Kubernetes resources into a single manifest file
(named `all.yaml`). When not enabled (the default) Kargo Render produces a
separate manifest file named `<resource name>-<resource type>` for every
Kubernetes resource. Enabling this or not is strictly a matter of preference.

To enable combining manifests, use configuration like the following:

```yaml
configVersion: v1alpha1
branchConfigs:
# ...
- name: env/prod
  appConfigs:
    my-app:
      # ...
      outputPath: my-app
      combineManifests: true
```

## Convention over configuration

In the absence of a `kargo-render.yaml` file at the root of the default branch,
Kargo Render will assume:

* You are using [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) for configuration management.

* Environment-specific Kustomize overlays exist within paths in the default
  branch that _exactly_ match the names of the environment branches for which
  they are inputs. e.g. The Kustomize overlay to be rendered for any environment
  branch `x` exists within the path `x/`, relative to the root of the default
  branch.

* Changes should be committed directly to environment branches.

* Every Kubernetes resource will be rendered into its own manifest file and
  _not_ combined into a single manifest file.

* Rendered manifests will be stored in the `app/` directory of the environment
  branches.

If deemed acceptable, these assumptions permit Kargo Render to be used without
any configuration at all.
